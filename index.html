        <h2>What Is Food Wastage?</h2>
        <p>The wastage of food starts right from its production to the final consumption. While storing the grown crop,
            lots
            of food wastes because of improper storage. Purchasing more than the needed food in restaurants and hotels
            is
            also a major reason for food wastage. Sometimes, there is food prepared more than needed in our houses,
            which
            brings the wastage of lots of food. The food, prepared in the marriages and other functions, also causes
            food
            wastage in a huge amount.</p>
        <p>Food waste occurs along the entire spectrum of production, from the farm to distribution to retailers to the
            consumer. Reasons include losses from mold, pests, or inadequate climate control; losses from cooking; and
            intentional food waste.</p>

        <h2>How To Raise Awareness About Food Wastage?</h2>
        <P>Food waste is a global issue and is becoming a sticking point for many. It has been estimated that 32% of
            food
            produced worldwide goes to waste. While many significant changes have been made and initiatives introduced,
            it
            is still a problem that is rife throughout the world. We need to work together and adopt an approach that
            can
            help to take action on food waste.
            All most every single one of us has been wasteful when it comes to food. Many of us do not think twice when
            we
            throw away food that is uneaten or left to spoil. Much of this is down to a lack of understanding concerning
            wasted food throughout the production chain.</p>

        <P>So, let's look at how to raise awareness for food waste.</P>
        <div>
            <h3>Education is Vital:</h3>
            <p>All most every single one of us has been wasteful when it comes to food. Many of us do not think twice
                when
                we
                throw away food that is uneaten or left to spoil. Much of this is down to a lack of understanding
                concerning
                wasted food throughout the production chain.
                Some believe that we have an endless supply of food products, and those who simply have no idea. This is
                where
                we have to begin to educate people.
            </p>
            <div class="grid-container">

                    id="c">
            </div>
            <p>In the same way, as people have been educated about wasting energy or the harmful effects of smoking,
                educating
                people to understand the food waste problem is vital.
                Many causes of food waste lie between the supplier, retailer, and consumer, so every single person or
                entity
                must understand the impact of food waste to reduce food waste.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="b">
            <h3>Changing how people think about food waste:</h3>
            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.geEB1OrCDUW59c9kAjRheQHaE8?w=231&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.6&pid=1.7"
                id="x">
            <p>Food waste is less of a concern when eating out
                However, food waste doesn't appear to be as much on consumers' minds when eating outside the home. Fewer
                than
                one in five (19 percent) report always thinking about food waste while eating out and nearly two in five
                (39
                percent) say they never think about it.<br>
                It will have to be introduced in schools to change the thought processes of future generations. However,
                to
                make
                a change right here right now, it is important that all are educated about the cost, what they can do to
                reduce
                it, and how to deal with waste as well as what they can do with it.
                This could include educating people about purchasing less, how they store their foods, or even how the
                supermarkets can pass on edible food that has passed its use-by-date.Encouraging people to compost food
                scraps
                or turn them into soups and stocks is a simple example of raising awareness. Similarly, encouraging
                people
                only
                to buy what they need in the context of good food waste practices are practical steps along the journey.

            id="y">
        <p>Food security is an essential consideration for the government in the UK but also on an international level.
            By 2050, it is believed that food production will have to double by 100% to feed the 9 billion people on
            earth1.
            This is alarming, and it could mean that even more food is wasted. As a result, the government of almost
            every
            country in the world needs to create initiatives and campaigns to help make people aware of the food waste
            problem
            and establish sustainable food systems.We should consider individuals and businesses in this mix. While this
            is
            a
            form of education, it is a problem that they need to tackle with compelling advertising campaigns.</p>

        <h2>How To Prevent Food Wastage Before It Happens?</h2>
        <P>Wastage of food: Wasting food is a very unethical practice, since a lot of people live under malnourishment
            and
            do
            not have access to food.

            Ways in which we can prevent the wastage of food:</P>
        <ol>
            <li>Buying food items in the required quantities only.</li>
            <li>Avoiding unnecessary cooking.</li>
            <li>Keeping leftover food in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Trying to reuse leftover by making new recipes.</li>
            <li>Keeping a check of appetite before serving food.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are properly storing food in your refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Store grains in airtight containers and label containers with contents and the dates.</li>

            <h2>How is Food Waste Disposed of?</h2>
            <p>As a large amount of food waste ends up in landfill and thus emits the greenhouse gas methane,
                contributing to
                global
                warming, action must be taken to improve the disposal of food waste. Also, there is great social
                responsibility,
                as
                not all food waste is inherently bad or inedible, therefore alternatives should be used to reduce
                waste.Food
                waste comprises of all sorts of edible and inedible matter, created across many industries, mainly
                household and
                commercial.</p>
            <h3>Household food Waste:</h3>
            <p>Household food waste comprises of leftover food, food preparation waste and even unopened packaged food.
                Local
                authorities often collect food waste in a separate bin to encourage residents to recycle food instead of
                sending
                it to landfill. Household food waste is often used to created biogas (explained below) or compost.</p>

                id="e">
            <h3>Commercial Food Waste:</h3>
            <p>Common commercial food waste includes unsellable food (past ‘use by’), leftover food from consumers,
                unsold food
                and by-products from manufacturing of food/drink products. Business waste is not managed by local
                authorities,
                therefore commercial waste management providers are enlisted to transport and dispose of the food waste.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="i">
            <h2>The Best Ways to Dispose of Food Waste</h2>
            <p>Listed are some of the best disposal methods for food waste, as well as ways in which consumers and
                businesses
                can reduce the amount of food waste they produce.</p>
            <h3>Food Waste Recycling</h3>
            <p>By recycling food waste and recovering value from it, individuals and businesses ensure their waste is
                put to
                good use. Here are the main sustainable food disposal methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anaerobic Digestion--Waste food is sorted, packaging removed, and liquid added (waste liquid from
                    food
                    production) to create a
                    soup-like mixture. This mixture is then warmed to encourage the growth of anaerobic bacteria, then
                    left for
                    60 days to allow the bacteria to break down the food. This process creates methane, which can be
                    used as
                    biogas for energy, and a rich fertiliser for growing more food.</li>

                <li>Food Waste Dewatering--Removing the water content from food waste can reduce bulk and weight up to
                    80%. Even
                    ‘dry’ waste can hold
                    lots of water, so food waste is dewatered by being ground and pushed through increasingly smaller
                    tubes to
                    squeeze out moisture. The final product is light and small blocks of food which are cheap to
                    transport due
                    to size and weight, and can be used as cattle feed</li>

                <li>Composting-- One of the most common and sustainable methods of food waste disposal, composting is
                    when food
                    waste naturally decomposes and creates fertiliser which can be done by businesses and individuals.
                    To
                    increase the success of composting, cardboard or newspaper can be used to balance out the acidity
                    and heat,
                    as well as microbe-rich soil to bolster microorganisms decomposing food. Oxygen is needed as this
                    process is
                    aerobic, not anaerobic, so air flow is encouraged by alternating layers of soil and carboard, and
                    carefully
                    turning the compost every two days</li>

        <h2>Global Benefits Of Reducing Food Loss</h2>
        <p>Reducing food waste is an important and achievable approach to making both food production and consumption
            more
            sustainable </p>
        <h3>Environmental Benefits</h3>
        <p>Food waste also impacts the environment and contributes to climate change. WRAP (Waste & Resources Action
            Programme) says that food waste is responsible for 7% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, which is 3.3
            billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2<sub>e</sub>) per year.

            By preventing one tonne of food waste from ending up in a landfill, we can prevent approximately 5 tonnes of
            CO2<sub>e</sub> from being emitted.</p>
        <p>A 2013 FAO report estimated that 1.4 billion hectares of land, which is 28% of the total global agricultural
            area, as well as 250km3 of blue water, are used to produce food that is then wasted. Sustainable approaches
            to
            food production can decrease this waste and reduce the carbon footprint of food manufacturing.

            After all, it is believed that a solution to food waste lies in adopting a “sustainable production and
            consumption approach throughout the global food supply chain”.</p>
        <h3>Financial Benefits</h3>
        <p>Reducing food loss and waste has financial benefits for businesses as well. After all, according to the UN,
            food
            waste adds up to a cost of $940 billion a year, a staggering figure. Just in the UK, the manufacturing and
            retail sector is estimated to waste 1.9 million tonnes of food a year worth £1.9 billion.

            According to WRAP, grocery retail food waste costs £3,100 per tonne, manufacturing waste costs £1,200 per
            tonne,
            and packaging waste costs £1,600 per tonne. By targeting these areas and investing in more sustainable
            solutions, costs are likely to reduce.

            This has already been proven. An analysis of 1,200 sites across 700 companies in 17 countries around the
            world
            reports that 99% of sites had a positive ROI when it came to investing in food loss and waste reduction
            programs. Some sites even reported that, for every £1 or $1 invested, they achieved 14 times more return on
            their investment.</p>
        <h3>Food Security Benefits</h3>
        <p>As we have mentioned, around 800 million people go hungry. A 2013 paper also estimates that 30% to 50% of all
            food produced on the planet is lost before “reaching a human stomach”.

            By ensuring the reduction of food waste, we could potentially feed globally everyone suffering from
            malnutrition. By reducing the tonnes of food going to waste every year, most of it avoidable, we can expect
            that
            food security will improve.



            Food loss and waste is a global concern and tackling it will bring a wealth of benefits to the environment,
            manufacturers and distributors, and people.

        <h3>Basics of Food Donation</h3>

        <h4>Anyone Can Be a Food Donor</h4>
        <p>Large manufacturers, supermarket chains, wholesalers, farmers, food brokers, and organized community food
            drives
            typically give food to food banks. Restaurants, caterers, corporate dining rooms, hotels, and other food
            establishments promptly distribute perishable and prepared foods to people in their communities. Many food

        <h4>Where to Donate</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Food pantries, food banks and food rescue programs collect food and redistribute it to those in need
                across
                the country.</li>
            <li>Food banks are community-based, professional organizations that collect food from a variety of sources
                and
                save the food in warehouses. The food bank then distributes the food to families and individuals through
                a
                variety of emergency food assistance agencies, such as soup kitchens, youth or senior centers, shelters
                and
                pantries. Most food banks tend to collect nonperishable foods such as canned goods because they can be
                stored for a longer time.</li>
            <li>Food rescue organizations operate food rescue programming, which includes the retrieval of excess food
                from
                donors and/or the delivery of donated food directly to clients or to other organizations that
                redistribute
                food to clients. These organizations may also offer other programming, such as education/skills training
                and
                the repurposing of donated food into meals or other food products, etc., and many of them apply software
                solutions, like apps, to coordinate the redistribution of excess food by volunteers or other
                organizations.

        <h3>Ideas for Increasing Food Donations in Your Community</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Leverage or establish relationships with food rescue organizations to donate food after events.
            </li>
            <li>Reach out to your local grocers, restaurants, venues and/or schools to suggest they donate wholesome
                food.
            </li>
            <li>Create a schedule for pick-up of donated food from your organization or business on a weekly, biweekly,
                or
                monthly basis.</li>
            <li>Become a volunteer for a food rescue organization to help transport food from donors to food recipient
                organizations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analysis of Food Wastage</h2>
        <p> China wastes the most food annually, with an estimated 91.6 million tonnes of discarded food annually. India
            wastes the second most food, with 68.8 million tonnes. The United States wastes the third most food, with 45
            million tonnes.
            Other countries that waste a lot of food include: Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico
            The two countries with the largest populations generate the highest food waste totals. For example, China
            and India produce more household food waste than any other country worldwide</p>

        <h3>Food Waste by Country 2023</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>China</h3>
            The gross amount of food waste in China exceeds 91 million tons. The large quantities of food waste reported
            by China, while considerable, probably shouldn't be too much of a surprise for the world's most populous
            country.

            <h4>India</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste for India exceeds 68 million tons. Much like China, India's sheer population
            numbers unsurprisingly result in larger amounts of unused food.

            <h4>United States</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in the US exceeds 19 million tons. While other countries can cite population
            numbers as the inherent reason for food waste, the US can't make that claim. For the most powerful nation on
            earth, food waste is a result of being the world's largest consumer of food.

            <h4>Japan</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in Japan exceeds 8 million tons. Although Japan can't make the same
            population boasts as larger countries, it is a densely populated land. That is also the primary culprit for
            Japan's large food waste numbers.

            <h4>Germany</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in Germany exceeds 6 million tons. Germany, like several other European
            nations, owes its food waste excess to both size and wealth.

            <h4>France</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in France exceeds 5 million tons. Known for its love of food and baked goods,
            France is less known for its food waste, a problem it shares with fellow European nations.

            <h4>United Kingdom</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in the UK exceeds 5 million tons. Even the most regal of countries are not
            immune to the issue of food waste, and the UK is exhibit number one.

            <h4>Russia</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in Russia exceeds 4 million tons. Russia's food waste excess is in large part
            due to the size and number of people that live in this vast country.

            <h4>Spain</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in Spain exceeds 3 million tons. The country of Spain is well known for its
            celebrations and food, but much of that food becomes waste, also putting Spain on the food waste by country
            list.

           <h4> Australia</h4>
            The gross amount of food waste in Australia exceeds 2 million tons. Arguably one of the more surprising
            countries on the list, Australia rounds out the food waste by country list. What makes Australia such an
            unexpected member of the food-waste club is that Australia is also a world leader in green energy and
            conservation efforts.</p>
